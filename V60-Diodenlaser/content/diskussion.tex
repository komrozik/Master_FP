\section{Conclusion and discussion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
The three major results of this experiment coincide with the expected theoretical values.
The first part confirms the existence of a threshold current at which the diode laser starts to lase.
The rubidium fluorescence could also be observed by adjusting the laser to the matching frequency.
We had some problems with the demonstration of the four absorption peaks on the oscilloscope, namely the fourth peak 87a was not visible for the most part of the experiment.
Only the fine tuning we did in the end showed a slight peak.
The reason for the trouble at finding the last peak may be that the intensity of the laser was not strong enough to cause sufficient 87a transitions so that the peak did not stand out to much from the baseline intensity.
